# Matrix-calculator
Matrix Calculator(C99):  
First project of (hopefully) many others to come. 
The project was created in C language (C99 standard) and implements a basic matrix calculator. After compiling and running the program the user will be presented with a menu that allows him to select the desired matrix operation.

Usage notes:  
Please note that for matrix addition the matrices must be of the same size, and that for the computation of a determinant and inverse the matrix must be square.
Due to the limitations of the Laplace expansion for determinants which was implemented, please stick to a maximum matrix size of 4 by 4 when calculating determinants/a matrix's inverse. Gauss-Jordan and row echelon form based computations may be added in the future.

Thank you for reading and please enjoy!
